#### Design with Grid

The `CSS Grid Layout` is a new module that enables a column and row layout. The most common layout is the `12-equal-column grid` since it is easily divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6, making it easier to create a responsive design.

[Grid by Examples](https://gridbyexample.com) is a great resource for presentations, videos and code examples of `CSS Grid Layouts`.
